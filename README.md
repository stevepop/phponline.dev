## Coding Standards
As this is a Laravel application, we will be following the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standard.

Interfaces should NOT be suffixed with Interface, Traits should NOT be suffixed with Trait
Class and method names must be descriptive enough with type-hints since we are not enforcing docblocks
If you can, please write tests to accompany the features that you submit.
